    "1. Applications for a sequence-to-sequence RNN include machine translation, speech recognition, and generating text. Sequence-to-vector RNNs can be used for sentiment analysis, image captioning, and speech recognition. Vector-to-sequence RNNs are useful for tasks such as image and video generation, speech synthesis, and music generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The inputs of an RNN layer must have three dimensions: batch size, time steps, and number of features. The batch size represents the number of sequences in a batch, the time steps represent the length of each sequence, and the number of features represents the number of features in each time step. The outputs of an RNN layer also have three dimensions: batch size, time steps, and number of units.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In a deep sequence-to-sequence RNN, all but the last RNN layer should have return_sequences=True, as each layer needs to output a sequence for the next layer to process. For a sequence-to-vector RNN, only the last RNN layer should have return_sequences=False, as the final output should be a vector rather than a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For forecasting the next seven days of a daily univariate time series, an RNN architecture such as an LSTM or GRU with a sequence-to-sequence architecture would be appropriate. The input to the RNN would be a sequence of the previous days' values, and the output would be a sequence of the predicted values for the next seven days.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The main difficulties when training RNNs include vanishing gradients, exploding gradients, and overfitting. To handle vanishing gradients, techniques such as gradient clipping, weight initialization, and gating mechanisms (e.g., LSTM) can be used. Exploding gradients can be handled using gradient clipping. Overfitting can be addressed by using dropout regularization, early stopping, and reducing the network's complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The LSTM cell's architecture includes three gates (input gate, forget gate, and output gate) and a memory cell. The input gate controls the input to the cell, the forget gate controls the memory cell, and the output gate controls the output of the cell. The gates are controlled by sigmoid activations and the memory cell is controlled by a hyperbolic tangent activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. 1D convolutional layers can be used in an RNN to capture local patterns in the input sequence, which can improve the model's ability to learn temporal dependencies. 1D convolutional layers can be used in place of or in addition to RNN layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture such as a 3D CNN or a combination of 2D CNNs and RNNs could be used to classify videos. The CNN layers would be used to extract spatial features from each frame, and the RNN layers would be used to capture temporal dependencies between the frames.\n",
